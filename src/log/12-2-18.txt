Virtualenv I was working in broke, have to set up another virtual environment 
and reinstall everything.

inside 3.6vev
install TensorFlow -- done
install PyTorch -- done
install onnx -- done
install onnx-tf -- done

get convert_vk.py to run -- done

bug fixes
    import os needed

    fixed naming discrepency with tfout / fout / tout

I think convert.py may be working now!

Should change the import of the PyTroch Net class used to train the model to an
argparser argument.
