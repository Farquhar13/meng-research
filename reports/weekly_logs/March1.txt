Monday 
    Goals:
	-Benchmark DataGenerator class
	-run reader.py
        -understand code

    Running DataGenerator gives “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uproot'”
        -Reading https://vsupalov.com/docker-arg-env-variable-guide/ and
	-https://vsupalov.com/6-docker-basics/ to try to understand how docker builds environments
	-watched 2 videos on docker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBtWxj9l7zM

Tuesday
    Goal:
        -Understand Docker containers

    -Reading Docker documentation parts 1-3 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/   
    -Watching 3 docker tutorial videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGYAg7TMmp0&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAAzevEST2qm2Xbe3aeLFvLc&index=1
    -Reading post-installation steps https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/
    -Running readme instructions from https://github.com/dmwm/CMSKubernetes/tree/master/docker
    -Not able to run without sudo, last line “docker run hello-world” gives  “permission denied”
        -Going to check stackoverflow tomorrow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42164653/docker-in-docker-permissions-error 

Wednesday
    Goals: 
        - Continue learning Docker
	    - Fix Permission error so I can run without sudo --done
	- Run cms readme instructions from https://github.com/dmwm/CMSKubernetes/tree/master/docker
	- If docker stuff goes well, run reader.py
	- If I get stuck, start working on math proof

    - Fixed Permission error by restarting computer after following commands. Apparently loging 
      out of docker and closing terminal wasn't enough
    - Reading Docker documentation parts 1-4 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
        - Installing VM Virtual Box to continue with tutorial
    - Investigating how to build dasgo image. Just copy Dockerfile? Navigate to directory somehow?
    
Thursday
    Goals:
    	- Run MLaaS4HEP docker container
        - Run reader.py

    - Removed images and rebuilt MLaaS4HEP images
    - Successfully ran MLaaS4HEP docker container!
    - Command to run: docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -i -t farquhar13/mlaas4hep /bin/bash

Friday
    Goals:
        - Run reader.py
	- Benchmak DataGenerator class 

    - Able to run reader.py!
    - Running reader.py requires an input .root file. I have the Tau_run file, but it is not
      available from within the docker container. I think I need to mount the directory
    - Able to run with access to .root file!
    - Docker command: docker run -v $PWD/data-vol:/tmp -i -t farquhar13/mlaas4hep /bin/bash this 
      mounts data-vol in my directory within MLaaS4HEP to /tmp in container (doesn't show up with
      ls, but still cd /tmp/ works)
    - Error writing output in reader.py: "TypeError: keys must be a string" when writing with 
      json.dumps()
